Saff grew up without a mother and would often be babysat by the various Preheats residents, though most had trouble figuring her out. Sweet was her most frequent babysitter, as Saff had the strongest attachment to her, an attachment that is still strong to this day.\n\nSaff's biggest interest is art, and she considers herself a stern critic in all aspects of the form. She can be very creatively rude with her comments and critiques, getting major reactions out of people. She also has a habit of wandering wherever she feels like, ending up in random places unsupervised.",
